## First Prompt

Within the `breakout-gemini` directory:

Read `AGENTS.md`, `SPEC.md`, and `LICENSE` before beginning.

Implement the Breakout game described in `SPEC.md`, following the instructions in `AGENTS.md` and the licensing requirements in `LICENSE`.

Create all necessary application files, including `index.html` and any CSS or JavaScript files you need. Keep the implementation simple and do not introduce external dependencies.

After implementation, summarize the files you created, explain how to run the game, and describe how to test it against the requirements in `SPEC.md`. Be honest about any tests you have not actually performed.
