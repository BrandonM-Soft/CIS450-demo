Implement the Breakout game described in `SPEC.md`, following the instructions in `AGENTS.md` and the licensing requirements in `LICENSE`.

Create all necessary application files, including `index.html` and any CSS or JavaScript files you need. Keep the implementation simple and do not introduce external dependencies.
